  # A product price can be discounted in two ways:
  #
  # * with a relative or an absolute product discount, which will be automatically
  # applied to all prices in a product that match a discount predicate.
  #   A relative discount reduces the matching price by a fraction (for example 10 %
  # off). An absolute discount reduces the matching price by a fixed amount (for
  # example 10â‚¬ off). If more than one product discount matches a price, the
  # discount sort order determines which one will be applied.
  # * with an external product discount, which can then be used to explicitly set a
  # discounted value on a particular product price.
  #
  # The discounted price is stored in the discounted field of the Product Price.
  #
  # > Note that when a discount is created, updated or removed it can take up to 15
  # minutes to update all the prices with the discounts.
  #
  # The maximum number of ProductDiscounts that can be active at the same time is **200**.
